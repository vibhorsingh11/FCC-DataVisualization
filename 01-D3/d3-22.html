<!-- The last challenge created the circleelements for each point in the dataset, and appended them to the SVG canvas. But D3 needs more information about the position and size of each circleto display them correctly.

A circlein SVG has three main attributes. The cxand cyattributes are the coordinates. They tell D3 where to position the center of the shape on the SVG canvas. The radius (rattribute) gives the size of the circle.

Just like the rectycoordinate, the cyattribute for a circleis measured from the top of the SVG canvas, not from the bottom.

All three attributes can use a callback function to set their values dynamically. Remember that all methods chained after data(dataset)run once per item in dataset. The dparameter in the callback function refers to the current item in dataset, which is an array for each point. You use bracket notation, like d[0], to access the values in that array.


Add cx, cy, and rattributes to the circleelements. The cxvalue should be the first number in the array for each item in dataset. The cyvalue should be based off the second number in the array, but make sure to show the chart right-side-up and not inverted. The rvalue should be 5 for all circles. -->
