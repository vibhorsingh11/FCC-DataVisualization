<!-- The last challenge created an svgelement with a given width and height, which was visible because it had a background-colorapplied to it in the styletag. The code made space for the given width and height.

The next step is to create a shape to put in the svgarea. There are a number of supported shapes in SVG, such as rectangles and circles. They are used to display data. For example, a rectangle (<rect>) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.

When you place a shape into the svgarea, you can specify where it goes with xand ycoordinates. The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. Positive values for xpush the shape to the right, and positive values for ypush the shape down from the origin point.

To place a shape in the middle of the 500 (width) x 100 (height) svgfrom last challenge, the xcoordinate would be 250 and the ycoordinate would be 50.

An SVG recthas four attributes. There are the xand ycoordinates for where it is placed in the svgarea. It also has a heightand widthto specify the size.


Add a rectshape to the svgusing append(), and give it a widthattribute of 25 and heightattribute of 100. Also, give the rectxand yattributes each set to 0. -->
